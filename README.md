# Cyclone Intensity Estimation 🌀💨

## Overview
This project predicts the intensity of cyclones using a deep learning model. The model is trained to estimate cyclone intensity based on infrared satellite images.

## Dataset
📦 The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle. You can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sshubam/insat3d-infrared-raw-cyclone-images-20132021).

## Model Architecture
ℹ️ The model architecture is defined in the `Model` class in the `cyclone_model.py` file.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to run the project:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or 3.10
- PyTorch
- Streamlit
- Other dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cyclone-intensity-estimation.git
2. Change into the project repository:
	```bash
	cd cyclone-intensity-estimation
3. Install the dependencies:
	```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt

## Model Loading 
Ensure the pre-trained model (`cyclone_model.pth`) is available in the project directory.

## Run the Streamlit app
	streamlit run app.py
